<p> I'm trying to succeed in the cybersecurity field. </p>
<p> I love listening to music, beatboxing, and playing volleyball. </p> 
<p> I am not married I am 18</p>
<p> I'm taking this course as a prerequisite of the courses that I'll have in the future for my cybersecurity major. I hope to get to know more people through networking and find out about their journeys because they are truly beautiful. A quote that I definitely believe in is that two brains are bigger than one, so working as a team is very important in the tech scene. </p>
<p> I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life. I don't have a favorite quote from one of the leaders, but I've always loved Elder Gong and Elder Uchtdorf. My favorite scripture is Zephaniah 3:17 because it's about how the Lord will give us joy through singing, which I love.</p>
